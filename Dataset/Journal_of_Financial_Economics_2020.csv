Empirical analysis of corporate tax reforms: What is the null and where did it come from?,"Absent theoretical guidance, empiricists have been forced to rely upon numerical comparative statics from constant tax rate models in formulating testable implications of tradeoff theory in the context of natural experiments. We fill the theoretical void by solving in closed-form a dynamic tradeoff theoretic model in which corporate taxes follow a Markov process with exogenous rate changes. We simulate ideal difference-in-differences estimations, finding that constant tax rate models offer poor guidance regarding testable implications. While constant rate models predict large symmetric responses to rate changes, our model with stochastic tax rates predicts small, asymmetric, and often statistically insignificant responses. Even with very long regimes (one decade), under plausible parameterizations, the true underlying theory—that taxes matter—is incorrectly rejected in about half the simulated natural experiments. Moreover, tax response coefficients are actually smaller in simulated economies with larger tax-induced welfare losses.","['Christopher A. Hennessy', 'Akitada Kasahara', 'Ilya A.

Leveraged buyouts and bond credit spreads,"Recent decades have witnessed several waves of buyout activity. We find leveraged buyouts (LBOs) to be a significant concern for bondholders by showing that a) intra-industry credit spreads increase upon an LBO announcement, b) yields on bonds without event risk covenants are, on average, 21 basis points higher than those on same-firm bonds with such covenants, and c) structural models calibrated to historical LBO events imply an impact of 18–21 basis points on 10-year credit spreads. The impact is strongest in expansion periods and for bonds with maturities of 10–20 years.","['Yael Eisenthal-Berkovitz', 'Peter Feldhütter', 'Vikrant Vig']","['Credit spreads', 'LBO risk', 'Structural models', 'Leveraged buyouts']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301801,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,3
Do fire sales create externalities?,"We develop three novel measures of the incentives of equity mutual funds to internalize the price impact of their trading. We show that mutual funds with stronger incentives to internalize their price impact accommodate inflows and outflows by adjusting their cash buffers instead of trading in portfolio securities. As a result, stocks held by these funds have lower volatility, and flows out of these funds have smaller spillover effects on other funds holding the same securities. Our results provide evidence of meaningful fire sale externalities in the equity mutual fund industry.","['Sergey Chernenko', 'Adi Sunderam']","['Fire sales', 'Liquidity management', 'Mutual funds']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301928,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,3
Betting against correlation: Testing theories of the low-risk effect,"We test whether the low-risk effect is driven by leverage constraints and, thus, risk should be measured using beta versus behavioral effects and, thus, risk should be measured by idiosyncratic risk. Beta depends on volatility and correlation, with only volatility related to idiosyncratic risk. We introduce a new betting against correlation (BAC) factor that is particularly suited to differentiate between leverage constraints and behavioral explanations. BAC produces strong performance in the US and internationally, supporting leverage constraint theories. Similarly, we construct the new factor SMAX to isolate lottery demand, which also produces positive returns. Consistent with both leverage and lottery theories contributing to the low-risk effect, we find that BAC is related to margin debt while idiosyncratic risk factors are related to sentiment.","['Cliff Asness', 'Andrea Frazzini', 'Niels Joachim Gormsen', 'Lasse Heje Pedersen']","['Asset pricing', 'Leverage constraints', 'Lottery demand', 'Margin', 'Sentiment']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1930176X,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,3
Are early stage investors biased against women?,"We study whether early stage investors have gender biases using a proprietary data set from AngelList that allows us to observe private interactions between investors and fundraising startups. We find that male investors express less interest in female entrepreneurs compared to observably similar male entrepreneurs. In contrast, female investors express more interest in female entrepreneurs. These findings do not appear to be driven by within-gender screening/monitoring advantages or gender differences in risk preferences. Moreover, the male-led startups that male investors express interest in do not outperform the female-led startups they express interest in—they underperform. Overall, the evidence is consistent with gender biases.","['Michael Ewens', 'Richard R.

Employment effects of unconventional monetary policy: Evidence from QE,"This paper investigates employment effects of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing policies (QE) via a bank lending channel. We find that banks with higher mortgage-backed securities holdings refinanced relatively more mortgages after the first round of QE, which increased local consumption and employment in the nontradable goods sector. In contrast, banks increased lending to firms and home purchase mortgage origination after the third round of QE, which led to a sizable increase in overall employment. Our findings are supported by new confidential loan-level data that show firms with stronger ties to affected banks increased employment and capital investment more during QE3.","['Stephan Luck', 'Tom Zimmermann']","['Bank lending channel', 'Quantitative easing']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301771,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,3
Governance through shame and aspiration: Index creation and corporate behavior,"After decades of de-prioritizing shareholders’ economic interests and low corporate profitability, Japan introduced the JPX-Nikkei400 in 2014. The index highlighted the country’s “best-run” companies by annually selecting the 400 most profitable of its large and liquid firms. We find that managers competed for inclusion in the index by significantly increasing return on equity (ROE), and they did so at least in part due to their reputational or status concerns. The ROE increase was predominantly driven by improvements in margins, which were in turn partially driven by cutting research and development (R&D) intensity. Our findings suggest that indexes can affect managerial behavior through reputational or status incentives.","['Akash Chattopadhyay', 'Matthew D. Shaffer', 'Charles C.Y.

"Left-tail momentum: Underreaction to bad news, costly arbitrage and equity returns","This paper documents a significantly negative cross-sectional relation between left-tail risk and future returns on individual stocks trading in the US and international countries. We provide a behavioral explanation to this anomaly based on the idea that investors underestimate the persistence in left-tail risk and overprice stocks with large recent losses. Thus, low returns in the left-tail of the distribution persist into the future causing left-tail return momentum. We find that the left-tail risk anomaly is stronger for stocks that are more likely to be held by retail investors, that receive less investor attention, and that are costlier to arbitrage.","['Yigit Atilgan', 'Turan G.

Pricing structured products with economic covariates,We introduce a top-down no-arbitrage model for pricing structured products. Losses are described by Cox processes whose intensities depend on economic variables. The model provides economic insight into the impact of structured products on financial institutions’ risk exposure and systemic risk. We estimate the model using CDO data and find that spreads decrease with higher interest rates and increase with volatility and leverage. Volatility is the primary determinant of variation in tranche spreads. Leverage and interest rates are more closely associated with rare credit events. Model-implied risk premiums and the probabilities of tranche losses increase substantially during the financial crisis.,"['Yong Seok Choi', 'Hitesh Doshi', 'Kris Jacobs', 'Stuart M.

Time series momentum: Is it there?,"Time series momentum (TSM) refers to the predictability of the past 12-month return on the next one-month return and is the focus of several recent influential studies. This paper shows that asset-by-asset time series regressions reveal little evidence of TSM, both in- and out-of-sample. While the t-statistic in a pooled regression appears large, it is not statistically reliable as it is less than the critical values of parametric and nonparametric bootstraps. From an investment perspective, the TSM strategy is profitable, but its performance is virtually the same as that of a similar strategy that is based on historical sample mean and does not require predictability. Overall, the evidence on TSM is weak, particularly for the large cross section of assets.","['Dashan Huang', 'Jiangyuan Li', 'Liyao Wang', 'Guofu Zhou']","['Time series momentum', 'Risk premium', 'Return predictability', 'Pooled regression']",[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301953,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,3
A comparison of some structural models of private information arrival,"We show that the PIN and the Duarte and Young (2009) (APIN) models do not match the variability of noise trade in the data and that this limitation has severe implications for how these models identify private information. We examine two alternatives to these models, the Generalized PIN model (GPIN) and the Odders-White and Ready (2008) model (OWR). Our tests indicate that measures of private information based on the OWR and GPIN models are promising alternatives to the APIN’s Adj.PIN and PIN.","['Jefferson Duarte', 'Edwin Hu', 'Lance Young']",[],[],March,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301965,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,3
Portfolio rebalancing in general equilibrium,"This paper develops an overlapping generations model of optimal rebalancing where agents differ in age and risk tolerance. Equilibrium rebalancing is driven by a leverage effect that influences levered and unlevered agents in opposite directions, an aggregate risk tolerance effect that depends on the distribution of wealth, and an intertemporal hedging effect. After a negative macroeconomic shock, relatively risk-tolerant investors sell risky assets, while more risk-averse investors buy them. Owing to interactions of leverage and changing wealth, however, all agents have higher exposure to aggregate risk after a negative macroeconomic shock and lower exposure after a positive shock.","['Miles S.

Shrinking the cross-section,"We construct a robust stochastic discount factor (SDF) summarizing the joint explanatory power of a large number of cross-sectional stock return predictors. Our method achieves robust out-of-sample performance in this high-dimensional setting by imposing an economically motivated prior on SDF coefficients that shrinks contributions of low-variance principal components of the candidate characteristics-based factors. We find that characteristics-sparse SDFs formed from a few such factors—e.g., the four- or five-factor models in the recent literature—cannot adequately summarize the cross-section of expected stock returns. However, an SDF formed from a small number of principal components performs well.","['Serhiy Kozak', 'Stefan Nagel', 'Shrihari Santosh']",[],[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301655,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
Trading and arbitrage in cryptocurrency markets,"Cryptocurrency markets exhibit periods of large, recurrent arbitrage opportunities across exchanges. These price deviations are much larger across than within countries, and smaller between cryptocurrencies, highlighting the importance of capital controls for the movement of arbitrage capital. Price deviations across countries co-move and open up in times of large bitcoin appreciation. Countries with higher bitcoin premia over the US bitcoin price see widening arbitrage deviations when bitcoin appreciates. Finally, we decompose signed volume on each exchange into a common and an idiosyncratic component. The common component explains 80% of bitcoin returns. The idiosyncratic components help explain arbitrage spreads between exchanges.","['Igor Makarov', 'Antoinette Schoar']","['Cryptocurrencies', 'Bitcoin', 'Arbitrage', 'Price impact', 'Capital controls']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301746,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
Show me the money: The monetary policy risk premium,"We create a parsimonious monetary policy exposure (MPE) index based on observable firm characteristics that previous studies link to how stocks react to monetary policy. Our index successfully captures stocks’ responses to both conventional and unconventional monetary policy. Stocks whose prices react more positively to expansionary monetary policy (high-MPE stocks) earn lower average returns. This result is consistent with the notion that high-MPE stocks provide a hedge against bad economic shocks, to which the Federal Reserve responds with expansionary monetary policy. A long-short trading strategy designed to exploit this effect achieves an annualized Sharpe Ratio of 0.77.","['Ali Ozdagli', 'Mihail Velikov']","['Monetary policy', 'Asset pricing', 'Risk factors']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301709,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
Quantify the quantitative easing: Impact on bonds and corporate debt issuance,"This paper studies the impact of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Corporate Sector Purchase Programme (CSPP) announcement on prices, liquidity, and debt issuance in the European corporate bond market using a data set on bond transactions from Euroclear. I find that the quantitative easing (QE) programme increased prices and liquidity of bonds eligible to be purchased substantially. Bond yields dropped on average by 30 basis points (bps) (8%) after the CSPP announcement. Tri-party repo turnover rose by 8.15 million USD (29%), and bilateral turnover went up by 7.05 million USD (72%). Bid-ask spreads also showed significant liquidity improvement in eligible bonds. QE was successful in boosting corporate debt issuance. Firms issued 2.19 billion EUR (25%) more in QE-eligible debt after the CSPP announcement, compared to other types of debt. Surprisingly, corporates used the attracted funds mostly to increase dividends. These effects were more pronounced for longer-maturity, lower-rated bonds, and for more credit-constrained, lower-rated firms.",['Karamfil Todorov'],"['Quantitative easing', 'Corporate Sector Purchase Programme', 'ECB', 'Bond market', 'Corporate debt issuance']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301941,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
Trading out of sight: An analysis of cross-trading in mutual fund families,"This paper explores how mutual fund groups set the price of in-house transactions among affiliated funds. We collect a data set of four million equity transactions and compare the pricing of trades crossed internally (cross-trades) with that of twin trades executed with external counterparties. While cross-trades should reduce transaction costs for both trading parties, we find that the price of cross-trades is set strategically to reallocate performance among sibling funds. Furthermore, we provide evidence that a large number of cross-trades are backdated. We discuss the implications for the literature on fund performance and the current regulatory debate.","['Alexander Eisele', 'Tamara Nefedova', 'Gianpaolo Parise', 'Kim Peijnenburg']","['Mutual fund families', 'Cross-trades', 'Monitoring', 'Backdating', 'Transfer pricing']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301734,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
An ill wind? Terrorist attacks and CEO compensation,"Using multiple measures of attack proximity, we show that CEOs employed at firms located near terrorist attacks earn an average pay increase of 12% after the attack relative to CEOs at firms located far from attacks. CEOs at terrorist attack-proximate firms prefer cash-based compensation increases (e.g., salary and bonus) over equity-based compensation (e.g., options and stocks granted). The effect is causal and it is larger when the bargaining power of the CEO is high. Other executives and workers do not receive a terrorist attack premium.","['Yunhao Dai', 'P.

Measuring skewness premia,"We provide a new methodology to empirically investigate the respective roles of systematic and idiosyncratic skewness in explaining expected stock returns. Using a large number of predictors, we forecast the cross-sectional ranks of systematic and idiosyncratic skewness, which are easier to predict than their actual values. Compared to other measures of ex ante systematic skewness, our forecasts create a significant spread in ex post systematic skewness. A predicted systematic skewness risk factor carries a significant and robust risk premium that ranges from 6% to 12% per year. In contrast, the role of idiosyncratic skewness in pricing stocks is less robust.",['Hugues Langlois'],"['Systematic skewness', 'Coskewness', 'Idiosyncratic skewness', 'Large panel regression', 'Forecasting']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X1930159X,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
Reputations and credit ratings: Evidence from commercial mortgage-backed securities,"How do changes in a rating agency's reputation affect the ratings market? We study the dynamics of credit ratings after Standard & Poor's (S&P) was shut out of a large segment of the commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) ratings market following a procedural mistake. Exploiting the fact that most CMBS have ratings from multiple agencies, we show that S&P subsequently eased its standards compared to other raters. This coincided with a partial recovery in the number of deals S&P was hired to rate. Our findings suggest that an agency can regain market share after suffering reputational damage by issuing optimistic ratings.","['Ramin P.

Financing dies in darkness? The impact of newspaper closures on public finance,"We examine how local newspaper closures affect public finance outcomes for local governments. Following a newspaper closure, municipal borrowing costs increase by 5–11 basis points, costing the municipality an additional $650,000 per issue. This effect is causal and not driven by underlying economic conditions. The loss of government monitoring resulting from a closure is associated with higher government wages and deficits and increased likelihoods of costly advance refundings and negotiated sales. Overall, our results indicate that local newspapers hold their governments accountable, keeping municipal borrowing costs low and ultimately saving local taxpayers money.","['Pengjie Gao', 'Chang Lee', 'Dermot Murphy']","['Media', 'Monitoring', 'Public finance', 'Municipal bonds']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301606,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
An inconvenient cost: The effects of climate change on municipal bonds,"Counties more likely to be affected by climate change pay more in underwriting fees and initial yields to issue long-term municipal bonds compared to counties unlikely to be affected by climate change. This difference disappears when comparing short-term municipal bonds, implying the market prices climate change risks for long-term securities only. Higher issuance costs for climate risk counties are driven by bonds with lower credit ratings. Investor attention is a driving factor, as the difference in issuance costs on bonds issued by climate and nonclimate affected counties increases after the release of the 2006 Stern Review on climate change.",['Marcus Painter'],"['Climate change', 'Municipal bonds', 'Sea level rise', 'Investor attention']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301631,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
Institutional shareholders and corporate social responsibility,"This study uses two distinct quasi-natural experiments to examine the effect of institutional shareholders on corporate social responsibility (CSR). We first find that an exogenous increase in institutional holding caused by Russell Index reconstitutions improves portfolio firms’ CSR performance. We then find that firms have lower CSR ratings when shareholders are distracted due to exogenous shocks. Moreover, the effect of institutional ownership is stronger in CSR categories that are financially material. Furthermore, we show that institutional shareholders influence CSR through CSR-related proposals. Overall, our results suggest that institutional shareholders can generate real social impact.","['Tao Chen', 'Hui Dong', 'Chen Lin']","['Institutional ownership', 'Indexing', 'Shareholder attention', 'Corporate social responsibility', 'Random discontinuity']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301643,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
Inventor CEOs,"One in five U.S. high-technology firms are led by CEOs with hands-on innovation experience as inventors. Firms led by “Inventor CEOs” are associated with higher quality innovation, especially when the CEO is a high-impact inventor. During an Inventor CEO's tenure, firms file a greater number of patents and more valuable patents in technology classes where the CEO's hands-on experience lies. Utilizing plausibly exogenous CEO turnovers to address the matching of CEOs to firms suggests these effects are causal. The results can be explained by an Inventor CEO's superior ability to evaluate, select, and execute innovative investment projects related to their own hands-on experience.","['Emdad Islam', 'Jason Zein']","['Inventor CEOs', 'CEO style', 'Innovation', 'Human capital']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301667,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2
Is information risk priced? Evidence from abnormal idiosyncratic volatility,"We propose a new, price-based measure of information risk called abnormal idiosyncratic volatility (AIV) that captures information asymmetry faced by uninformed investors. AIV is the idiosyncratic volatility prior to information events in excess of normal levels. Using earnings announcements as information events, we show that AIV is positively associated with informed return run-ups, abnormal insider trading, short selling, and institutional trading during pre-earnings-announcement periods. We find that stocks with high AIV earn economically and statistically larger future returns than stocks with low AIV. Taken together, our findings support the notion that information risk is priced.","['Yung Chiang Yang', 'Bohui Zhang', 'Chu Zhang']","['Information risk', 'Idiosyncratic volatility', 'Earnings announcement', 'Expected returns']",[],February,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301710,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,2

Dynamic interventions and informational linkages,"We model a dynamic economy with strategic complementarity among investors and study how endogenous government interventions mitigate coordination failures. We establish equilibrium existence and uniqueness, and we show that one intervention can affect another through altering the public information structure. A stronger initial intervention helps subsequent interventions through increasing the likelihood of positive news, but also leads to negative conditional updates. Our results suggest optimal policy should emphasize initial interventions when coordination outcomes tend to correlate. Neglecting informational externalities of initial interventions results in over- or under-interventions. Moreover, saving smaller funds disproportionally more can generate greater informational benefits at smaller costs.","['Lin William Cong', 'Steven R.

Providing liquidity in an illiquid market: Dealer behavior in US corporate bonds,"We examine market making behavior of dealers for 55,988 corporate bonds, many of which trade infrequently. Dealers have a substantially higher propensity to offset trades within the same day rather than committing capital for longer periods for riskier and less actively traded bonds. Dealers’ holding periods do not decline with a bond's prior trading activity and in fact are lowest for some of the least active bonds. As a result, cross-sectional estimates of roundtrip trading costs do not increase as prior trading activity declines. Our results suggest that dealers endogenously adjust their behavior to mitigate inventory risk from trading in illiquid and higher risk securities, balancing search and inventory costs in equilibrium such that observed spreads can appear invariant to expected liquidity.","['Michael A.

The job rating game: Revolving doors and analyst incentives,"Investment banks frequently hire analysts from rating agencies. While many argue that this “revolving door” creates captured analysts, it can also create incentives to improve accuracy. To study this issue, I construct an original data set, linking analysts to their career paths and the securitized finance ratings they issue. First, I show that accurate analysts are more frequently hired by underwriting investment banks. Second, I exploit two distinct sources of variation in the likelihood of being hired by a bank. Both indicate that, as this likelihood rises, analyst accuracy improves. The findings suggest policymakers should consider incentive effects alongside capture concerns.",['Elisabeth Kempf'],"['Revolving door', 'Career concerns', 'Analysts', 'Credit ratings', 'Securitized finance']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301370,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,1
Potential pilot problems: Treatment spillovers in financial regulatory experiments,"The total effects of a regulatory change consist of direct effects and indirect effects (spillovers), but the standard difference-in-difference approach mostly ignores potential indirect effects. During the 2007 full repeal of the uptick rule, short-sellers become much more aggressive across the board, even in control stocks where the uptick rule is already suspended. This finding is consistent with positive and significant indirect effects on control stocks, likely driven by aggressive broad list-based shorting. In contract, the indirect effect coefficients on shorting aggressiveness are negative for the 2005 partial uptick repeal, possibly due to substitutions between control and treatment stocks.","['Ekkehart Boehmer', 'Charles M.

Idea sharing and the performance of mutual funds,"I develop an equilibrium model to explain why few mutual fund managers consistently outperform, even though many have strong informational advantages. The key ingredient is that managers obtain investment ideas through idea sharing. Idea sharing improves statistical significance of alpha through increased price informativeness. But it also causes better informed managers to take larger positions, which makes their alpha noisier—although a significant fraction of managers builds strong informational advantages, statistical significance and persistence of alpha concentrate in underperforming funds. I argue that in-house development of ideas cannot explain these facts.",['Julien Cujean'],"['Idea sharing', 'Performance', 'Rational-expectations equilibrium']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301400,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,1
Squaring venture capital valuations with reality,"We develop a valuation model for venture capital–backed companies and apply it to 135 US unicorns, that is, private companies with reported valuations above $1 billion. We value unicorns using financial terms from legal filings and find that reported unicorn post-money valuations average 48% above fair value, with 14 being more than 100% above. Reported valuations assume that all shares are as valuable as the most recently issued preferred shares. We calculate values for each share class, which yields lower valuations because most unicorns gave recent investors major protections such as initial public offering (IPO) return guarantees (15%), vetoes over down-IPOs (24%), or seniority to all other investors (30%). Common shares lack all such protections and are 56% overvalued. After adjusting for these valuation-inflating terms, almost one-half (65 out of 135) of unicorns lose their unicorn status.","['Will Gornall', 'Ilya A.

Exchanges of innovation resources inside venture capital portfolios,"I explore the prevalence of exchanges of innovation resources inside venture capital portfolios. I show that after companies join investors’ portfolios, several proxies of exchanges between them and portfolio companies (relative to matched nonportfolio companies) increase by an average of 60%. The increase holds when joining events are plausibly exogenous and when VCs’ bargaining power and potential conflicts of interest are low. Three novel mechanisms are supported: carve-outs, spawning, and recycling, whereby entrepreneurs divest innovation units, start new ventures, and reuse assets in other portfolio companies, respectively. Results suggest that returns to innovation are higher in venture capital portfolios.",['Juanita González-Uribe'],"['Venture capital portfolios', 'Innovation resources', 'State pension funds']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301424,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,1
How do venture capitalists make decisions?,"We survey 885 institutional venture capitalists (VCs) at 681 firms to learn how they make decisions. Using the framework in Kaplan and Strömberg (2001), we provide detailed information on VCs’ practices in pre-investment screening (sourcing evaluating and selecting investments), in structuring investments, and in post-investment monitoring and advising. In selecting investments, VCs see the management team as somewhat more important than business-related characteristics such as product or technology although there is meaningful cross-sectional variation across company stage and industry. VCs also attribute the ultimate investment success or failure more to the team than to the business. While deal sourcing, deal selection, and post-investment value-added all contribute to value creation, the VCs rate deal selection as the most important of the three.

"Shorting flows, public disclosure, and market efficiency","Shorting flows remain a significant predictor of negative future stock returns during 2010–2015, when daily short-sale volume data are published in real time. This predictability decays slowly and lasts for a year. Long-term shorting flows are more informative than short-term shorting flows. Indeed, abnormal short-term shorting flows do not predict future returns or anticipate bad news. We find that short sellers exploit prominent anomalies. A comparison with the Regulation SHO data indicates that the predictability is much shorter-term during 2005–2007. Short sellers appear to have shifted from trading on short-term private information to trading on long-term public information that is gradually incorporated into prices.","['Xue Wang', 'Xuemin\xa0(Sterling) Yan', 'Lingling Zheng']","['Short sale', 'Public disclosure', 'Return predictability', 'Anomalies']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301436,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,1
"Anomalies across the globe: Once public, no longer existent?","Motivated by McLean and Pontiff (2016), we study the pre- and post-publication return predictability of 241 cross-sectional anomalies in 39 stock markets. We find, based on more than two million anomaly country-months, that the United States is the only country with a reliable post-publication decline in long-short returns. Collectively, our meta-analysis of return predictors suggests that barriers to arbitrage trading can create segmented markets and that anomalies tend to represent mispricing instead of data mining.","['Heiko Jacobs', 'Sebastian Müller']","['Return predictability', 'International stock markets', 'Arbitrage', 'Publication impact', 'Anomalies']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301618,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,1
"Earnings, retained earnings, and book-to-market in the cross section of expected returns","Book value of equity consists of two economically different components: retained earnings and contributed capital. We predict that book-to-market strategies work because the retained earnings component of the book value of equity includes the accumulation and, hence, the averaging of past earnings. Retained earnings-to-market predicts the cross section of average returns in U.S. and international data and subsumes book-to-market. Contributed capital-to-market has no predictive power. We show that retained earnings-to-market, and, by extension, book-to-market, predicts returns because it is a good proxy for underlying earnings yield (Ball, 1978; Berk, 1995) and not because book value represents intrinsic value.","['Ray Ball', 'Joseph Gerakos', 'Juhani T.

Time to build and the real-options channel of residential investment,"A standard real-options model predicts that time-to-build investment could be delayed by uncertainty over future revenue. We quantify the first-order importance of this mechanism in the 2002–2011 housing boom-bust cycle by developing and estimating a model of sequential irreversible investment with stochastic bottlenecks. We find that the main driver of construction delays during the boom is construction bottlenecks. However, further delay in construction during the bust is caused by an increase in uncertainty, which grew by 21.6% between 2002 and 2009. The model can account for more than one-third of the decline in residential investment between 2002 and 2009.","['Hyunseung Oh', 'Chamna Yoon']","['Investment', 'Housing', 'Real options']",[],January,https://www.sciencedirect.com//science/article/pii/S0304405X19301722,Journal of Financial Economics,2020,135,1
