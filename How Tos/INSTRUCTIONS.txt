"Please, save the code and the data in one folder. In the code, change the path to the data according to the data's current location in the google drive folder. And, yes, to run the code, I go to the Jupyter notebook, from there, I go to Google drive, and then I find the code and run it. It takes me to a browser.

We used this way because my collaborator and I wanted to access the data and the code simultaneously.

You can change it by saving the data on your system and changing that line of code to read the data. In this case, you do not have to open a Jupyter notebook and go the Google drive.

I hope this helps. Let me know if not.

It would be great if you all can make a group to send my answer to everyone. They might have the same question."
