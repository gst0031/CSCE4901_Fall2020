# Version check
$ python -m django --version

# Create a project
$ django-admin startproject mysite

# Run DEV server (from website directory - the one with manage.py)
$ python manage.py runserver

# Changing the port (default is: 8000) 
$ python manage.py runserver 8080

- NOTE: Automatic reloading of runserver
The development server automatically reloads Python code for each request as needed. You don’t need to restart the server for code changes to take effect. However, some actions like adding files don’t trigger a restart, so you’ll have to restart the server in these cases.
